# Django project - KanMind backend

**KanMind** is a task management and collaboration platform designed for teams and individuals to manage tasks, track progress, and collaborate effectively. The platform includes features like task assignment, comment threads, role-based access control, and user authentication. It's designed with an easy-to-use REST API to manage all operations related to tasks, users, and boards.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, log in, and manage user profiles with token-based authentication.
- **Boards**: Create boards and manage members. Tasks are organized within boards.
- **Tasks**: Create, update, and delete tasks. Tasks can be assigned to users and can have reviewers.
- **Comments**: Add comments to tasks for easy collaboration and feedback.
- **Permissions**: Custom permissions to ensure that only board members or owners can update tasks.
- **User Profiles**: Create and manage user profiles with additional information (bio, location, etc.).

## Authentication and Permissions

**knamind** uses token-based authentication with the `django-rest-framework` package to authenticate users. Users must register and log in to access any of the platformâ€™s features.

Custom permissions are applied to ensure that:

- Only members of a board or the board owner can perform updates on tasks.
- Task assignment and reviewer selection are restricted to board members.
- User profiles and task data are securely managed.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Django 3.2 or later
- PostgreSQL or another compatible database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY-LINK>
   cd <projectfolder>
   
2. Set up a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    env/Scripts/activate  # Windows
    source env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
Note: On macOS/Linux, python3 may have to be used instead of python.

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up the database:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate

5. Create a superuser (admin):

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser

6. Run the server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
Tip: If errors occur, check the `settings.py` for paths, database settings or forgotten `.env` files.

Now, you can access the application at http://localhost:8000.
